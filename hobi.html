<p>Football or Futsal is one. I always play futsal with my friens every weekend. It is time to release my stress with playing futsal. I dream to become a football player but I know its hard journey for me because my age it's already 21. The professional player always start their career on young age in high school. Thats not the reason to me let go of my dream. Age is just number, let the result prove it to the world. </p>

<p>I like to listen the music. The genre of music that I like to listen as long the musice is good to hear. I like to play the song based on mood. Every morning, I open tha playlist that I have done arrange it. The song that make me feel more passion to start my day. I also prepared the music before I have a match for football or futsal. Sometime I will hear motivation speech from my playlist.</p>
